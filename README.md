This repository contains the material related to the paper *Two real use cases of FAIR maturity indicators in the life sciences*, currently on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/739334v1). 

The core implementation is in Jupyter notebook and it is on binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sbonaretti/FAIR_metrics/master?filepath=code%2FFAIR_assessment_2.ipynb)  
We also applied our visualization to a dataset previously collected by [Dunning et al.](http://www.ijdc.net/article/view/567/493): [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sbonaretti/FAIR_metrics/master?filepath=code%2FFAIR_comparison.ipynb)

The final website of this paper, updated after my departure from the group is [here](https://nanocommons.github.io/wgf-fairdata-analysis/)
